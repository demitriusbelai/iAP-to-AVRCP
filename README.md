# iAP to AVRCP

## What is this?
This is my terrible answer to not being able to change the current song from my steering wheel in my 2012 Hyundai Elantra.

## What does it do?
It (is supposed to) act as a bridge between Bluetooth (AVRCP) and the Apple iPod Accessory Protocol (iAP). 

## Should I use it?
No. You're honestly better off just changing the head unit in your car.

## Can I use it?
You're free to do [whatever*](LICENCE.txt) you want with this. Just please don't judge me for the terrible code written within. I just wanted to change the damn song.
